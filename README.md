# CMPUT652_Algonauts
The following cells in the notebook aligns with the baseline code provided in the Algonauts challenge. GoogleColab Pro or Jupyter notebook is the preferred platform for execution of this program due to computational complexities and memory overflow issues. 
Different versions of this pipeline with variants of resnet and ensemble model were executed on MacBook Pro with batch processing and modular programming of sequential jobs.

NOTE: this notebook is just for comprehending the pipeline and might encounter with overflow issues if executed
